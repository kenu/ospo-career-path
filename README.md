# 👋 Welcome OSPO Career Path Repo

OSPO Career Path is a set of vendor-neutral, open source, and free courses created by folks from the TODO / OSPO community to support training inside the organization. Each course is intended to be modularized so the content is reusable in a piecemeal fashion.

The target audience of the OSPO Career path is intended to Open Source professionals that are in a role that manages, oversees, or guides the organization’s policies and/or contributions to open source projects. This includes:

* Security, compliance, and licensing open source roles
* Open Source developer relations, developer advocates, or community managers
* Open Source project managers
* Open Source leaders and general managers

## 📖 What defines an OSPO: Definition and characteristics

### OSPO Definition

An open source program office (OSPO) is designed to (1) be the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure and (2) put a strategy and set of policies on top of an organization's open source efforts. This can include setting code use, distribution, selection, auditing, and other policies, training developers, ensuring legal compliance, and promoting and building community engagement that benefits the organization strategically. See the OSPO definition hosted by the TODO Group for more information.
OSPO Characteristics

To a certain degree, any organization calling itself an OSPO likely indicates that the organization has reached a maturity stage, gained critical mass support with its enterprise, and manifests five key characteristics:
* Employees are tasked with fostering and nurturing OSS usage.
* The organization has a formal policy around the use and production of OSS.
* Executives recognize that OSS and open source more broadly are important strategic assets.
* Significant numbers of employees are contributing code to open source projects.
* Processes, procedures, and tools are in place to streamline and facilitate open source consumption and participation
* See the OSPO characteristics hosted by the TODO Group for more information.
